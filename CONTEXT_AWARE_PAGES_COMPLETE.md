# ✅ Context-Aware AI Pages - Implementation Status

## 🎯 **Pages Updated (READY TO TEST!)**

### **1. Opportunities Page** ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/opportunities/page.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- ✅ Imports `startContextualAnalysis` utility
- ✅ `loadDetailedAnalysis` now builds context with opportunity data
- ✅ Passes context type `"opportunity"` with full opportunity info
- ✅ Uses callback-based API for clean state management
- ✅ AI button passes opportunity data on click

**Context Passed**:
```typescript
{
  type: "opportunity",
  symbol: "NVDA",
  page: "opportunities",
  panel: "opportunity-card",
  data: {
    risk_level: "HIGH",
    score: 8.5,
    timeframe: "SWING",
    title: "NVIDIA momentum play",
    reasoning: "..."
  }
}
```

**Backend Routing**:
- Routes to standard stock analysis workflow
- `stream_stock_analysis_with_text()` called
- Full multi-agent team: Market Analyst, Social Analyst, News Analyst, Fundamentals Analyst

### **2. Market Regime Page** ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/market-regime/page.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- ✅ Imports `startContextualAnalysis` utility  
- ✅ `handleMarketAnalysis` now builds context with regime data
- ✅ Passes context type `"market"` with VIX, SPY, yield data
- ✅ Uses callback-based API

**Context Passed**:
```typescript
{
  type: "market",
  symbol: "SPY",
  page: "market-regime",
  panel: "regime-overview",
  data: {
    volatility_regime: "HIGH_VOLATILITY",
    market_trend: "BEARISH",
    risk_sentiment: "RISK_OFF",
    vix_level: 28.5,
    spy_trend: -5.2,
    yield_10y: 4.2,
    yield_change: 0.15
  }
}
```

**Backend Routing**:

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Opportunities Page Flow**:
```
User clicks "✨ AI" button on NVDA opportunity
    ↓
Frontend builds context with opportunity data (risk_level, score, etc.)
    ↓
POST /api/analyze-contextual-stream with context
    ↓
Backend sees type="opportunity"
    ↓
Routes to standard stock analysis
    ↓
Streams back: Market Analyst → Social Analyst → News Analyst → Fundamentals Analyst
    ↓
Frontend displays in drawer with real-time text streaming
```

### **Market Regime Page Flow**:
```
User clicks "Market Analysis" button
    ↓
Frontend builds context with VIX, SPY, yield data
    ↓
POST /api/analyze-contextual-stream with context
    ↓
Backend sees type="market"
    ↓
Routes to SPECIALIZED market regime workflow ✨
    ↓
Streams back: Macro Economist → Market Technician → Risk Analyst → Sentiment Analyst
    ↓
Frontend displays macro-focused analysis
```

## 🧪 **Test It Now!**

### **Test 1: Opportunities Page**

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/MikeyW/true-north-trading
   python backend/scripts/runners/run_backend.py
   ```

2. **Start Frontend** (in new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/MikeyW/true-north-trading/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Steps**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3002/opportunities
   - Click "✨ AI" button next to any stock (e.g., NVDA)
   - Watch drawer open
   - **Look in backend logs** for: `🎯 Contextual Analysis Request: type=opportunity`
   - See agents stream: Market Analyst → Social Analyst → News Analyst → Fundamentals
   - Get BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation

**Expected Backend Log**:
```
🎯 Contextual Analysis Request: type=opportunity, symbol=NVDA, page=opportunities, panel=opportunity-card
📊 Routing to STOCK analysis for NVDA
```

---

### **Test 2: Market Regime Page**

1. **With servers running**, go to http://localhost:3002/market-regime

2. **Test Steps**:
   - Click "Market Analysis" button in header
   - Watch drawer open
   - **Look in backend logs** for: `🎯 Contextual Analysis Request: type=market`
   - **Different agents** stream: Macro Economist → Market Technician → Risk Analyst → Sentiment Analyst
   - Get RISK_ON/RISK_OFF/NEUTRAL stance

**Expected Backend Log**:
```
🎯 Contextual Analysis Request: type=market, symbol=SPY, page=market-regime, panel=regime-overview
🌍 Routing to MARKET analysis (SPY proxy)
🌍 Starting MARKET REGIME analysis...
🤖 Running Macro Economist for market analysis...
```

## 🎉 **Key Achievements**

1. ✅ **Context-aware routing** - Different workflows for different pages
2. ✅ **Data passing** - Page state flows to backend
3. ✅ **Specialized agents** - Market page gets macro-focused agents
4. ✅ **Clean architecture** - Reusable utility function
5. ✅ **Real-time streaming** - Word-by-word text display
6. ✅ **Beautiful UI** - Markdown rendering, progress bars, animations

---

## 🔧 **Debugging Tips**

### **If analysis doesn't start**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab - should see POST to `/api/analyze-contextual-stream`
3. Check backend logs for context routing message

### **If wrong agents run**:
1. Check backend logs for `type=` in context message
2. Verify context object in frontend (add `console.log(context)`)
3. Ensure `type` is one of: `"market" | "opportunity" | "stock" | "portfolio" | "trader" | "sector" | "alert"`

### **If streaming stops**:
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Verify OpenAI API key is set
4. Check network timeouts

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test both pages** following guides above
2. **Verify backend routing** in logs
3. **Confirm different agents** run for each page
4. **Apply pattern** to remaining pages (use guide)

**Status**: 🎯 **2 PAGES COMPLETE - READY TO TEST!**

The foundation is solid. Test these 2 pages, then apply the same pattern everywhere else! 🌟
