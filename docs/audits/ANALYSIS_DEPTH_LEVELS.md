## üéì Technical Deep Dive: How Agents Work

### Behind the Scenes (Level 2 & 3)

When you call `/enhanced-opportunities` or `/autonomous-discovery`:

```python
for stock in discovered_stocks:
    # 1. Market Analyst (30-45 seconds)
    market_data = yfinance.fetch(stock, period="1y")
    indicators = calculate_indicators(market_data)
    market_report = gpt4.analyze(market_data, indicators)
    
    # 2. Social Analyst (30-45 seconds)
    reddit_data = fetch_reddit_sentiment(stock)
    twitter_data = fetch_twitter_mentions(stock)
    social_report = gpt4.analyze(reddit_data, twitter_data)
    
    # 3. News Analyst (30-45 seconds)
    news = finnhub.get_news(stock)
    insider = finnhub.get_insider_transactions(stock)
    news_report = gpt4.analyze(news, insider)
    
    # 4. Fundamentals Analyst (30-45 seconds)
    balance_sheet = yfinance.get_balance_sheet(stock)
    cash_flow = yfinance.get_cashflow(stock)
    income = yfinance.get_income_statement(stock)
    fundamentals_report = gpt4.analyze(balance_sheet, cash_flow, income)
    
    # 5. Synthesize (15-20 seconds)
    investment_thesis = claude.synthesize(
        market_report,
        social_report,
        news_report,
        fundamentals_report
    )
    
    # 6. Debate (20-30 seconds)
    bull_case = gpt4_bull.argue(investment_thesis)
    bear_case = gpt4_bear.counter(bull_case)
