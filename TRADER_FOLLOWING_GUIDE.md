    name="Market Wizard",
    platform=TraderPlatform.TWITTER,
    username="marketwizard",
    primary_strategy="swing_trading",

```

### **2. Syncing Trader Activity**

# Sync all traders
await system.sync_trader_activity()

# Sync specific trader
await system.sync_trader_activity(trader_id="specific_trader_id")
```

### **3. Getting Recent Signals**

```python
# Get signals from last 24 hours
recent_signals = system.get_recent_signals(hours=24)

for signal in recent_signals:
    print(f"📊 {signal['symbol']} - {signal['trade_type']}")
    print(f"👤 Trader: {signal['trader_name']}")
    print(f"🎯 Confidence: {signal['confidence']:.0%}")
    print(f"💬 Signal: {signal['source_text']}")
```

### **4. Finding Consensus Opportunities**

```python
# Get signals where 2+ traders agree
consensus = system.get_consensus_signals(min_traders=2)

for signal in consensus:
    print(f"🤝 {signal['symbol']} - {signal['trader_count']} traders agree")

```

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Following Traders**

### **1. Trader Selection Criteria**

**Look for traders with:**
- ✅ **Consistent Performance**: 60%+ win rate over 6+ months
- ✅ **Transparent Reporting**: Posts both wins and losses
- ✅ **Risk Management**: Uses stop losses and position sizing
- ✅ **Specialization**: Focuses on specific strategies or sectors
- ✅ **Active Posting**: Regular updates and trade follow-ups

**Avoid traders who:**
- ❌ Only post winners (cherry-picking)
- ❌ Make vague predictions without specific prices
- ❌ Promote get-rich-quick schemes
- ❌ Have inconsistent strategies
- ❌ Don't provide risk management guidance

### **2. Diversification Strategy**

**Follow Multiple Types:**
- 📈 **Swing Traders**: 2-3 week holds, technical analysis focused
- ⚡ **Day Traders**: Intraday momentum and scalping
- 📊 **Options Traders**: Specialized in options strategies
- 🌍 **Sector Specialists**: Focus on specific industries (tech, biotech, etc.)
- 📰 **Event Traders**: Earnings, FDA approvals, economic events

**Platform Diversification:**
- 🐦 **Twitter**: Real-time calls and quick updates
- 📱 **Reddit**: Detailed analysis and community discussion
- 📊 **StockTwits**: Market sentiment and momentum
- 💬 **Discord**: Private communities with higher quality signals

### **3. Risk Management**

**Position Sizing:**
```python
# Never risk more than 2% per signal
max_risk_per_trade = 0.02
portfolio_value = 100000

# Calculate position size based on stop loss
entry_price = 100
stop_loss = 95
risk_per_share = entry_price - stop_loss
max_shares = (portfolio_value * max_risk_per_trade) / risk_per_share
```

**Confidence-Based Allocation:**
- 🔥 **High Confidence (80%+)**: 1.5-2% risk
- 🎯 **Medium Confidence (60-80%)**: 1% risk  
- ⚠️ **Low Confidence (<60%)**: 0.5% risk or skip

### **4. Signal Validation**

**Before Following a Signal:**
1. ✅ **Check Technical Analysis**: Does the chart support the call?
2. ✅ **Verify Fundamentals**: Any upcoming catalysts or earnings?
3. ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Is the risk/reward ratio favorable?
4. ✅ **Position Sizing**: Does it fit your portfolio allocation?
5. ✅ **Exit Strategy**: Clear stop loss and profit targets?

## 🔧 **Advanced Features**

### **1. Auto-Following with Safeguards**

```python
# Enable auto-following for top performers only
system.enable_auto_follow(
    trader_id="top_trader_id",
    max_position_size=0.02,  # Max 2% of portfolio per trade
    min_confidence=0.75,     # Only follow high-confidence signals
    max_daily_trades=3       # Limit to 3 trades per day
)
```

### **2. Custom Scoring Models**

```python
# Create custom trader scoring
def custom_trader_score(trader_performance):
    win_rate_score = trader_performance['win_rate'] / 100
    return_score = min(trader_performance['avg_return'] / 20, 1.0)  # Cap at 20%
    consistency_score = 1 - (trader_performance['volatility'] / 50)  # Lower vol = higher score
    
    return (win_rate_score * 0.4 + return_score * 0.4 + consistency_score * 0.2)
```

### **3. Sentiment Analysis Integration**

```python
# Combine with market sentiment
from enhanced_discovery_engine import EnhancedDiscoveryEngine

discovery = EnhancedDiscoveryEngine()
market_regime = await discovery.regime_detector.detect_market_regime()

# Adjust trader signals based on market conditions
if market_regime['risk_sentiment'] == 'RISK_OFF':
    # Be more selective with bullish signals
    min_confidence_threshold = 0.8
else:
    # Normal confidence threshold
    min_confidence_threshold = 0.6
```
