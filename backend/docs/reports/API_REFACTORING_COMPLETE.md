# ✅ API Refactoring Complete - Modular Architecture

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor the monolithic `main.py` (1044 lines) into a clean, modular architecture with separated concerns and proper dependency injection.

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before:
- **1 massive file:** `backend/api/main.py` (1044 lines)
- Global variables everywhere
- Mixed concerns (models, routes, dependencies)
- Hard to maintain and test
- Difficult to navigate

### After:
- **8 clean, focused files**
- Proper separation of concerns
- Dependency injection
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Clear structure

## 📁 New File Structure

```
/backend/api/
├── main.py                      # Clean entry point (152 lines) ⭐
├── models.py                    # Pydantic models (93 lines)
├── dependencies.py              # Dependency injection (130 lines)
├── main_old.py                  # Backup of original
└── endpoints/                   # Modular routers
    ├── __init__.py             # Router exports
    ├── market.py               # Market & sector endpoints (162 lines)
    ├── opportunities.py        # Opportunity discovery (129 lines)
    ├── traders.py              # Trader signals & leaderboard (178 lines)
    ├── portfolio.py            # Portfolio metrics (39 lines)
    └── analysis.py             # Stock analysis with TradingAgents (79 lines)
```

## 🔧 What Was Created

### 1. **`models.py`** - Pydantic Models

All API request/response models in one place:
- `MarketRegime`
- `Opportunity`
- `TraderSignal`
- `Alert`
- `PortfolioMetrics`
- `StockAnalysisRequest`
- `AgentAnalysis`
- `StockAnalysisResponse`

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for data structures
- Easy to find and update models
- Reusable across the application

---

### 2. **`dependencies.py`** - Dependency Injection

Centralized dependency management:
- Global instance storage
- Setter functions for initialization
- Getter functions for FastAPI injection
- Proper error handling if systems not initialized

**Example:**
```python
from backend.api.dependencies import get_discovery_engine

@router.get("/opportunities")
async def get_opportunities(
    engine: EnhancedDiscoveryEngine = Depends(get_discovery_engine)
):
    # engine is automatically injected!
    opportunities = await engine.discover_opportunities()
    return opportunities
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean dependency injection
- Testable (can mock dependencies)
- No more global variables in main.py
- Proper initialization checks

---

### 3. **`endpoints/`** - Modular Routers

#### **`market.py`** (162 lines)
- Market regime analysis
- Detailed market regime
- Sector rotation with caching

#### **`opportunities.py`** (129 lines)
- Get trading opportunities
- Run discovery engine
- Opportunity scoring and ranking

#### **`traders.py`** (178 lines)
- Trader signals
- Followed traders list
- Trader leaderboard with caching
- Alerts from monitoring system

#### **`portfolio.py`** (39 lines)
- Portfolio metrics
- Real-time performance tracking

#### **`analysis.py`** (79 lines)
- Stock analysis with TradingAgents
- Multi-agent analysis
- Comprehensive reports

**Benefits:**
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Easy to find specific endpoints
- Can be developed independently
- Clear API boundaries

---

### 4. **`main.py`** - Clean Entry Point (152 lines)

New main.py is super clean:
```python
# Just imports, setup, and router registration!

from backend.api.endpoints import (
    market_router,
    opportunities_router,
    traders_router,
    portfolio_router,
    analysis_router,
)

app = FastAPI(...)

# Register routers
app.include_router(market_router)
app.include_router(opportunities_router)
app.include_router(traders_router)
app.include_router(portfolio_router)
app.include_router(analysis_router)
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to see all routes at a glance
- Simple to add new routers
- Clean startup logic
- No business logic in main file

```bash
# Root endpoint
$ curl http://localhost:8002/
{
    "message": "True North Trading API is running",
    "status": "healthy",
    "version": "2.0.0"  # New version!
}

# Health check (NEW!)
$ curl http://localhost:8002/health

## 📚 How to Add New Endpoints

### Step 1: Create a new router file
```python
# backend/api/endpoints/my_feature.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from backend.api.dependencies import get_some_dependency

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api", tags=["my_feature"])

@router.get("/my-endpoint")
async def my_endpoint(dep = Depends(get_some_dependency)):
    return {"data": "value"}
```

### Step 2: Export it in `__init__.py`
```python
# backend/api/endpoints/__init__.py

from .my_feature import router as my_feature_router

__all__ = [..., "my_feature_router"]
```

### Step 3: Register in main.py
```python
# backend/api/main.py

from backend.api.endpoints import my_feature_router

app.include_router(my_feature_router)
```

Done! 🎉

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern

```
main.py (Entry Point)
   ↓
dependencies.py (DI Container)
   ↓
endpoints/ (Routers)
   ↓
models.py (Data Structures)
   ↓
core/ (Business Logic)
```

**This is a proper layered architecture!**
