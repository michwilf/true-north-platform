## Market Structure and Mechanics

### How Markets Actually Work

#### **Market Participants**
- **Retail Traders**: Individual investors (you)
- **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies
- **Hedge Funds**: Alternative investment funds seeking absolute returns
- **Market Makers**: Provide liquidity by quoting bid/ask prices
- **High-Frequency Traders (HFT)**: Algorithmic traders exploiting tiny price differences
- **Central Banks**: Government institutions affecting currency and bond markets

#### **Order Flow and Price Discovery**
- **Bid**: Highest price buyers are willing to pay
- **Ask**: Lowest price sellers are willing to accept
- **Spread**: Difference between bid and ask (your cost to trade)
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded (indicates interest/liquidity)
- **Price Discovery**: How markets determine "fair" prices through supply/demand

#### **Market Sessions and Timing**
- **Pre-Market**: 4:00-9:30 AM EST (lower volume, wider spreads)
- **Regular Hours**: 9:30 AM-4:00 PM EST (highest liquidity)
- **After-Hours**: 4:00-8:00 PM EST (lower volume, higher volatility)
- **Best Trading Times**: 10:00-11:30 AM and 2:00-3:30 PM EST
- **Avoid**: First/last 30 minutes (manipulation risk, wide spreads)

### Exchange vs OTC Markets

#### **Exchange-Traded (NYSE, NASDAQ)**
- **Centralized**: All orders go through central exchange
- **Transparent**: Order book visible to all participants
- **Regulated**: Strict rules and oversight
- **Liquid**: Generally better liquidity and tighter spreads

#### **Over-the-Counter (OTC)**
- **Decentralized**: Direct trading between parties
- **Less Transparent**: Limited order book visibility
- **Less Regulated**: Fewer protections and requirements

## Risk Management Fundamentals

### The 1% Rule and Position Sizing

#### **Core Principle**
Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on any single trade.

**Example Calculation**:
- Account Size: $10,000
- Risk per Trade: 1% = $100
- Entry Price: $50
- Stop Loss: $47
- Risk per Share: $3
- Position Size: $100 ÷ $3 = 33 shares maximum

#### **Portfolio Risk Limits**
- **Maximum Single Position**: 5% of account value
- **Maximum Total Risk**: 6% across all open positions
- **Correlation Limits**: No more than 3% risk in correlated positions
- **Sector Limits**: Maximum 20% in any single sector

### Types of Risk

#### **Market Risk (Systematic)**
- **Definition**: Risk affecting entire market
- **Examples**: Recessions, interest rate changes, geopolitical events
- **Management**: Diversification across asset classes, hedging

#### **ATR-Based Stops**
- **Calculation**: 1.5-2.0 × Average True Range below entry
- **Pros**: Adjusts for volatility
- **Cons**: More complex calculation

#### **Technical Stops**
- **Support/Resistance**: Below key technical levels
- **Moving Averages**: Below 20-day or 50-day MA
- **Pros**: Based on market structure
